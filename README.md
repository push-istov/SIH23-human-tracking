<h1>Human Tracking Pipeline<h1>
<p>Problem statement description: In outdoor operational scenarios, maintaining continuous and reliable surveillance is paramount for security and safety. 
  One of the most challenging aspects is robust human target detection and tracking, particularly under occlusions. 
  This statement addresses the need for a solution that ensures the accurate acquisition and locking of human targets while preserving tracking integrity, even when obscured by various obstacles.</p>

<p>The pipeline uses mediapipe and opencv2 along with centroid teracking script to enable human tracking with association capabilities ideally even on edge devices with minimal processing capabilities.</p>
<p>To run use script detect.py or detectvid.py</p>
